### Hey! I'm Marcos aka [@margobra8](https://marquitos.space)

I'm a Telecommunications Engineer and a Double MSc student in Systems, Control and Robotics at [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://kth.se).

I have previously did research work and studied at [Universidad PolitÃ©cnica de Madrid](https://upm.es) in the Signals, Systems and Radiocommunications (SSR) Department of ETSIT.

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on developing new systems and algorithms for real-time mmWave Radar signal processing in mobile communications and biomedical applications.
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning about real-time low-level hardware design, high-throughput FPGA DSP and RISC-V Machine Learning hardware acceleration.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about embedded systems design, Radar Signal Processing, DSP and Machine Learning.
